Mastermind is a classic mind game: a secret numeric code is generated (e.g., [1][1][2][3]) and you must figure it out using guesses and the hints provided.

Enter a guess and click Submit. Red pegs indicate how many spots contain the correct number in the correct position. White pegs indicate how many spots contain the correct number but in the wrong position.

The only way to lose is to give up!
